					On Februrary 3rd, 2018, the Italian town of Macerata turned into the scene of a terrorist attack: 28-year-old Luca Traini fired his gun, voluntarily wounding six African migrants. The attacker eveloped himself in an Italian flag and shouted "Long live Italy!" before surrendering to the police. He was soon recognised as a far-right sympathizer.
				</p>
				<p class= "intro-content">
					Since then, and especially after the March 2018 elections that saw nationalist party Lega raise to the government in a colation with populist Movimento Cinque Stelle, racially motivated attacks have multiplied beyond proportion. Just in the first three months of the year, 169 cases of racis were counted in Italy.

			    	Over fifty violent attacks towards migrants and refugees have been registered since arch 4th, when the elections took place. This timeline tracks these events to make a sense of the situation in the country.
